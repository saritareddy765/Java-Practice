Object:
       * It is an instance of a class.
       * created by using new keyword.
       * We can create multiple objects of the same class, and each will have its own state.
       * objects are stored in heap memory.
       * object can contain methods and variables.

Syntax:
       * ClassName objName = new ClassName();
            --> objName should be created any number of classes.

            -- ClassName: The name of the class.
            -- objectName: The reference variable pointing to the object.
            -- new ClassName(): Allocates memory and initializes the object.
       * call the methods or variables within the class or another class.
