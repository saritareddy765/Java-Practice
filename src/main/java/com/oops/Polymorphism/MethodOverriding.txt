Method overriding:
                * It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation
                     for a method that is already defined in its parent class.
                * It will be applicable only incase of inheritance.
                * Static methods cannot be overridden.
                * The method in the child class must have the same name,
                     return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.
                * The method in the child class must have an equal or more permissive access modifier than the parent method
                   (e.g., protected in the parent can be overridden with protected or public in the child).
                * Use the @Override annotation to ensure you're correctly overriding a method.
                     This will cause a compile-time error if the method is not correctly overridden.
                * Syntax:
                          class ParentClass{
                             returnType methodName(parameters){
                               // parent method implementation
                             }
                          }
                          class ChildClass extends ParentClass{
                          //if we are specifying the override annotation,then we should mandatory
                                    override the parent method in the child class.
                              @Override
                                returnType methodName(parameters){
                                 // child method implementation
                              }
                          }

Method overloading vs Method overriding:

method overloading:
                  * It is compile-time polymorphism.
                  * we can do with and without inheritance,(Single and Multiple inheritance).
                  * Same method name with different parameters.
                  * Happens within same class.
                  * Accesss modifier has no restrictions.
                  * Static methods can be overloaded.

method overriding:
                  * It is run-time polymorphism.
                  * It is possible only with inheritance(Two classes or more).
                  * Same method name and parameters list.
                  * Happens across parent and child classes.
                  * In access modifier,child's access must match or be boarder.
                  * Static methods cannot be overriden.
