Loop:
     * Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

Types:
     * for Loop
     * enhanced Loop (for-each)
     * while Loop
     * do-while Loop

for Loop:
         * for Loop Executes a block of code a specific number of times.
         * has nested for loop.
         * Syntax:
                  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                      // Code to execute
                  }
nested for Loop:
         * If we have a for loop inside the another loop, it is known as nested for loop.
         * The inner loop executes completely whenever outer loop executes.
         * Syntax:
                  for (initialization; termination; increment) {
                      // Outer loop block
                      for (initialization; termination; increment) {
                          // Inner loop block
                      }
                  }
         * The structure allows us to perform complex iterations by running a for loop
                  for each iteration of the outer for loop.
         * Nested for loops are particularly useful when working with multi-dimensional
             data structures like arrays or when we need to perform operations that
               require multiple levels of looping, such as generating a matrix or table.

for-each Loop:
         * Enhanced for Loop (for-each) Used to iterate over arrays or collections.
         * Syntax:
                  for (type variable : collection) {
                      // Code to execute
                  }
while Loop:
         * while Loop Executes as long as the condition is true.
         * Syntax:
                  while (condition) {
                      // Code to execute
                  }
Infinite While Loop:
            *
            * Syntax:
                     while(true){
                     //code to be executed
                     }
do-while Loop:
         *  Loop Executes the block of code at least once, then checks the condition.
         * Syntax:
                  do {
                      // Code to execute
                  } while (condition);
