StaticKeyword:
              * It can be applied to variables and methods.
              * static variables and methods placed in the class memory.
              * static variable values are hold the memory till the execution completed.
              * static variables and methods not placed in the object memory.
              * non-static variables and methods are placed in the object memory(multiple objects).
              * call by using the className. variable
              * used only for common properties.
              * Types:
                       1. static variables
                            -- we have to specify the static keyword.
                            -- static variables are also referred as class variable.
                            -- static variables are common to all the instances/objects of the class.
                       2. static methods
                            -- we have to specify the static keyword.
                            -- static methods are also referred as class methods.
                            -- A static method belongs to the class rather than any instance.
                            -- It can be called without creating an object of the class.
                            -- Rules:
                                    1. Can only access other static members (variables or methods).
                                    2. Cannot use this or super keywords.
                       3. non-static variables
                            -- not specify the static keyword.
                       4. non-static methods
                            -- not specify the static keyword.
              * Reduces memory usage by sharing common data across instances.
              * Overuse can make the program less object-oriented.
              * static keyword also used in Blocks and Nested class.
              * object creation is not required for static variables and methods.
              * used in Math.random() (random is also static).
              *
