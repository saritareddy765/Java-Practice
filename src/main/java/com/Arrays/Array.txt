Array:
     * An array is a collection of elements
         of the same data type stored in a contiguous memory location.
     * It is a fixed-size data structure that can hold
           multiple values in a single variable.
     * Fixed Size:
             The size of an array is determined when it is created and cannot be changed.
     * Indexed:
             Array elements are accessed using their index, starting from 0.
     * Homogeneous:
             All elements in an array must be of the same data type.
     * Static Memory Allocation:
             The memory for an array is allocated at compile-time.

Advantages:
     * Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
     * Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.
Disadvantages:
     * Size Limit: Arrays have a fixed size and do not grow dynamically at runtime.

Declaration:
            * dataType arrayName[];
                       or
            * dataType[] arrayName;

Initialization:
            * arrayName[] = new dataType[size];

Declaration and Initialization:
                       * dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[size];(also object creation).

Types:
            * Single-Dimensional Array.
            * Multi-Dimensional Array.
                --> Two Dimensional Array.
                --> Jagged Array.

Single Dimensional Array:
            * A simple list of elements.
            * one dimensional(only x-axis).
            * Syntax: dataType[] arrayName = {values};
            * Ex:          int[] a = {1,2,3,4,5}.

Multi Dimensional Array:
            * Arrays with more than one dimension.
            * To create a two-dimensional array, add each array
                    within its own set of curly braces:
            * Number of rows = number of columns.
            * Syntax: dataType[][] arrayName = {{values},{values},{values}};
            *Ex:       int[][] a = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};
                       int[][] b = new int[3][2]; 3 rows,2 columns.
                       int[][] c ={
                                   {1,2},
                                   {3,4},
                                   {5,6}
                       };

Jagged Array:
            * Jagged arrays are 2D arrays where
                  each row can have a different number of columns.
            * Syntax:  dataType[][]  arrayName = {{val}{}};
                       dataType[][] arrayName = new int[][];
                       int[][] a =new int[3][];
                        a[0] = new int[3];
                        a[1] = new int[5];
                        a[2] = new int[8];
perform:
            * Loops: for(),for-each.
            *
