Switch case:
            * switch Statement Allows multiple conditions to be checked
                   in a simpler way than if-else.

            * Syntax:
                      switch(expression){
                        case value1:
                            // statements (match the value executed)
                            break;
                        case value2:
                             // statements (match the value executed)
                             break;
                        default:
                            // statements (no match executed)
                      }
break:
            --> When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
            --> This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block
            --> When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break.
                     There is no need for more testing.
            --> A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores"
                   the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.
