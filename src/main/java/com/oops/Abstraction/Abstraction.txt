Abstraction:
           * It is a process of hiding implementation details
              and showing only the functionality to the user.
           * In Java,abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
           * Using Abstract class:
                      1. It is partial abstraction.
                      2. Abstract Class: -- A class that is declared with the abstract keyword.
                                         --  It can contain both abstract methods
                                             (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).
                                         -- Abstract Method: A method which contains method signature
                                                without body (No implementation written).
                      3. Syntax:
                                abstract class ClassName {
                                    abstract void methodName(); // Abstract method (no body)
                                    void concreteMethod() {
                                        // Concrete method (with body)
                                    }
                                }
