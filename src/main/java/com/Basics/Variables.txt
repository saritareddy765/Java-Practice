Variable:
         * Variables are containers for storing data values while the Java program is executed.
         * All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

Types:
         * Global Variables(Static and Non-Static variables)
         * Local Variables(Local variables and Parameters)

         * Instance Variables(Non-Static Fields)
             --> A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method,is called an instance variable.
             --> It is not declared as static.
             --> It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

         * Class Variables(Static Fields)
             --> A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable.
             --> It cannot be local.We can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class.
             --> Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

         * Local Variables
             --> A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable.
             --> We can use this variable only within that method.
             --> And the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.

Naming convection:
         * Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
         * Names must begin with a letter
         * Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
         * Names can also begin with $ and _
         * Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
         * Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
Syntax:
         * data-type var-name = var-value;
