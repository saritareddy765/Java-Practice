super keyword:
           * The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers
                to the immediate parent class of the current object.
           * It is primarily used for accessing members (fields or methods)
                and calling constructors of the parent class.
Uses:
           * Accessing Parent Class Variables.
              -- The super keyword can be used to access a parent class variable when
                   it is hidden by a variable of the same name in the child class.
           * Calling Parent Class Methods.
              -- The super keyword can be used to access a parent class variable
                    when it is hidden by a variable of the same name in the child class.
           * Calling Parent Class Constructors.
              -- The super() keyword is used to invoke the constructor of the parent class.
              -- It must be the first statement in the child class constructor.
           * Use super to call overridden methods or access hidden variables in the parent class.
           * The super keyword cannot be used in static methods or blocks because
              it refers to an instance, and static context does not involve instances.
