Method:
       * A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
       * You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
       * Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
       * Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

Syntax:
       * accessModifier staticOrNonStatic returnType methodName(parameters){
       //Method body

       }
       accessModifier: public.private,protect,default
       Return Type:
          -->Return type is a data type that the method returns.
          --> It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc.
          --> If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.
       Parameter List:
          --> It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses.
          --> It contains the data type and variable name.
          --> If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank.
       Method Body:
          --> It is a part of the method declaration.
          --> It contains all the actions to be performed.
          --> It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.
Naming convection:
        * Method name starts with lowerCase.
        * Single-word method name: sum(), area()
        * Multi-word method name: areaOfCircle(), stringComparision()

Types of Methods:
        * Pre-defined Methods
            --> predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods.
            --> It is also known as the standard library method or built-in method.
            --> We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point.
        * User-defined Methods
            --> The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method.
            --> These methods are modified according to the requirement.
