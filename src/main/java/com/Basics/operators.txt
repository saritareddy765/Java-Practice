Operators:
          * It is a symbol that perform operations on variables and values.
Types:
          * Arithmetic Operators.
          * Relational(Comparison) Operators.
          * Logical Operators.
          * Bitwise Operators.
          * Assignment Operators.
          * Unary Operators.
          * Ternary Operators.
Arithmetic Operators:
          --> Used for basic mathematical operations.
          --> Types: +,-,*,/,%.(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus)

Relational Operators:
          --> Used to compare two values.
          --> Types: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
          --> EqualTo, NotEqual, GreaterThan, LessThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, LessThanOrEqualTo.

Logical Operators:
          --> Used for logical operations, typically in decision-making.
          --> Types: &&, ||, !.
          --> Logical AND, Logical OR, Logical Not.

Bitwise Operators:
          --> Used for bit-level operations.
          --> Types: &, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>.
          --> Bitwise(AND, OR, Compliment, LeftShift, RightShift, UnsignedRightShift).

Assignment Operators:
          --> Used to assign values to variables.
          --> Types: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
          --> Assigns a Value, Adds and assigns, Subtract and assigns, Multiplies and assigns, Divide and assigns, Modulus and assigns.

Unary Operators:
          --> Used with a single operand.
          --> Types: +, -, ++, --, !.
          --> Unary plus, Unary minus, Increment, Decrement, Logical Not.
          --> ++a(Pre-Increment), a--(Post-Decrement).

Ternary Operators:
          --> A shorthand for if-else.
          --> Condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
          --> Ex: a > b ? a : b
